# Bit Indie V2 (Marketplace)

This is the clean rebuild.

Start here:
- `DEV.md` — canonical local-dev + handoff notes (for humans + agents)

Code:
- `apps/api` — TypeScript backend (Fastify + Prisma + Postgres + MinIO)

Canonical product/spec docs live in the parent workspace:
- `/home/josh/clawd/notes/marketplace/*`
