# 🎮 AUTO-FLW Bit Indie V2 — Auth/Store Construction Burst (Waves 39–40)

- Trigger: cron `24ab51e7-ceb8-4ee2-b0ab-27a98bd44e14`
- Mode: one 2-wave hybrid burst (sequential), strict non-overlap, no cosmetic churn
- Stop flag check: `ops/flw-auto-stop-biv2.json` => `stopped=false` (continued)

## Wave 39 (A+B auth compatibility fail-fast contract)
Shipped:
1. Added first-class auth compatibility endpoint:
   - `GET /auth/storefront/construction/runtime/fixture-bundle-compatibility`
   - Declares auth/storefront bundle versions + digests and explicit compatible pair matrix.
   - Adds fail-fast policy (`reject_ci_run`) on unknown auth/storefront bundle combinations.
2. Extended auth fixture bundle execution contract with:
   - `execution.compatibilityMatrix: /auth/storefront/construction/runtime/fixture-bundle-compatibility`
3. Added/updated auth route tests in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.test.ts`.

## Wave 40 (C+D storefront mirror compatibility surface)
Shipped:
1. Added storefront-side compatibility mirror endpoint:
   - `GET /storefront/scaffold/construction/fixture-bundle-compatibility`
   - Mirrors auth/storefront bundle pairing and unknown-pair reject policy.
2. Extended storefront fixture bundle execution contract with:
   - `execution.compatibilityMatrix: /storefront/scaffold/construction/fixture-bundle-compatibility`
3. Added/updated storefront route tests in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.test.ts`.

## Boundary merge gates (apps/api)
- `npm test --silent` ✅ PASS (16 files, 231 tests)
- `npm run build --silent` ✅ PASS
- merge-marker scan (`rg '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)' src`) ✅ PASS (no markers)

## Thrash / signal assessment
- Two consecutive PARTIAL with no substantive commits: **No**
- Signal quality: **High** (new machine-readable auth/storefront compatibility contracts + fail-fast CI policy + test coverage)

## Decision
- **CONTINUE** (stop flag unchanged).
- Next burst candidate: add compact compatibility guard endpoint that emits a single `ready=true/false` and `reason` payload for CI preflight consumption.
