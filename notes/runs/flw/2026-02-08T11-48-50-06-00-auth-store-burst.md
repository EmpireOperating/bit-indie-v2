# 🎮 AUTO-FLW Bit Indie V2 — Auth/Store Construction Burst (Waves 33–34)

- Trigger: cron `24ab51e7-ceb8-4ee2-b0ab-27a98bd44e14`
- Mode: one 2-wave hybrid burst (sequential), strict non-overlap, no cosmetic churn
- Stop flag check: `ops/flw-auto-stop-biv2.json` => `stopped=false` (continued)
- Commit base: `a5707a0`

## Wave 33 (A+B auth fixture payload skeletons)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /auth/storefront/construction/runtime/fixture-payload-skeletons` in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`.
   - Publishes deterministic JSON skeletons for headed QR approve payload and headless verify/session payloads.
   - Keeps boundary ownership explicit: auth templates issue session artifacts; storefront consumes resulting tokens.
2. Added route coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.test.ts`.

## Wave 34 (C+D storefront fixture payload skeletons)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /storefront/scaffold/construction/fixture-payload-skeletons` in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.ts`.
   - Publishes storefront entitlement probe payload shapes for both headed and headless tokenized lanes.
   - Wires dependencies to auth fixture payload endpoint and existing CI command template surfaces.
2. Added route coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.test.ts`.

Gate checkpoint (apps/api):
- `npm test --silent` ✅ (16 files, 221 tests)
- `npm run build --silent` ✅
- merge marker scan (`rg '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)' src`) ✅ (none)

## Thrash / signal assessment
- Result: **high-signal** (new executable payload skeleton contract surfaces + tests).
- No consecutive PARTIAL pattern in this burst.
- Auto-stop criterion not met.

## Decision
- **CONTINUE** (stop flag unchanged).
- Next burst should add machine-readable fixture bundle manifests (single-file lane packs) so CI can fetch one endpoint per lane and execute without hand assembly.
