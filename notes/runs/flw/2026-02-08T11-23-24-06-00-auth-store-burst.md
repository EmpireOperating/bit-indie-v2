# 🎮 AUTO-FLW Bit Indie V2 — Auth/Store Construction Burst (Waves 25–26)

- Trigger: cron `24ab51e7-ceb8-4ee2-b0ab-27a98bd44e14`
- Mode: one 2-wave hybrid burst (sequential), strict non-overlap, no cosmetic churn
- Stop flag check: `ops/flw-auto-stop-biv2.json` => `stopped=false` (continued)

## Wave 25 (auth runtime smoke-manifest contract)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /auth/storefront/construction/runtime/release-download-smoke-manifest` in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`.
   - Publishes executable smoke suites for headed direct-download, headed tokenized fallback, and headless tokenized access.
   - Binds each suite to auth lane sequence (A->C / B->C) and explicit expected HTTP status.
   - Links fixtures + upstream runtime acceptance/integration contracts for CI-style probes.
2. Added route test coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.test.ts`.

## Wave 26 (storefront smoke fixtures for parallel lanes)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /storefront/scaffold/construction/release-download/smoke-fixtures` in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.ts`.
   - Exposes executable smoke fixtures for headed direct, headed fallback, and headless tokenized download lanes.
   - Pins accepted token transports and assert blocks (`status`, `mode`) for deterministic contract testing.
   - Links upstream auth smoke manifest + acceptance fixtures for non-overlapping headed/headless contract surfaces.
2. Added route test coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.test.ts`.

Gate checkpoint (apps/api):
- `npm test --silent` ✅ (16 files, 211 tests)
- `npm run build --silent` ✅
- merge marker scan (`rg '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)' src`) ✅ (none)

## Thrash / signal assessment
- Result: **high-signal** (new executable smoke manifest + fixtures converting acceptance contracts into CI-probe-ready surfaces).
- No consecutive PARTIAL pattern in this burst.
- Auto-stop criterion not met.

## Decision
- **CONTINUE** (stop flag unchanged).
- Next burst should add minimal runner docs/scripts that consume these smoke fixtures end-to-end so lane probes can be fired by automation without manual assembly.
