# 🎮 AUTO-FLW Bit Indie V2 — Auth/Store Construction Burst (Waves 35–36)

- Trigger: cron `24ab51e7-ceb8-4ee2-b0ab-27a98bd44e14`
- Mode: one 2-wave hybrid burst (sequential), strict non-overlap, no cosmetic churn
- Stop flag check: `ops/flw-auto-stop-biv2.json` => `stopped=false` (continued)
- Commit base: `HEAD before burst`

## Wave 35 (A+B auth bundle-manifest construction)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /auth/storefront/construction/runtime/fixture-bundle-manifest` in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`.
   - Publishes a **single fetch-once auth fixture bundle contract** that enumerates headed QR approve + headless verify/session payload artifacts.
   - Keeps auth-owned bundle boundaries explicit and points to the companion storefront bundle endpoint.
2. Added route coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.test.ts`.

## Wave 36 (C+D storefront bundle-manifest construction)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /storefront/scaffold/construction/fixture-bundle-manifest` in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.ts`.
   - Publishes a **single fetch-once storefront fixture bundle contract** for headed/headless entitlement probes.
   - Wires explicit dependency to the auth fixture bundle to keep cross-surface CI handoff deterministic.
2. Added route coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.test.ts`.

Gate checkpoint (apps/api):
- `npm test --silent` ✅ (16 files, 227 tests)
- `npm run build --silent` ✅
- merge marker scan (`rg '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)' src`) ✅ (none found)

## Thrash / signal assessment
- Result: **high-signal** (new first-class fixture bundle contract surfaces + tests).
- No consecutive PARTIAL pattern in this burst.
- Auto-stop criterion not met.

## Decision
- **CONTINUE** (stop flag unchanged).
- Next burst should add compact machine-readable `bundleDigest`/`bundleVersion` fields plus minimal executable examples so CI can validate bundle freshness before running lanes.
