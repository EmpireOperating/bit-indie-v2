Date: 2026-02-08T14:13:30-06:00
Trigger: cron `24ab51e7-ceb8-4ee2-b0ab-27a98bd44e14` (`[AUTO-FLW] BI V2 every 15m (overnight)`)
Mode: AUTH/STORE CONSTRUCTION MODE (post-webhook hardening)

## Pre-check
- Stop flag (`ops/flw-auto-stop-biv2.json`):
  - `{"stopped":true,"reason":"diminishing returns (auth/store mode)","at":"2026-02-08T00:00:00Z"}`
- Protocol result: **run skipped immediately** (no waves executed).

## Actions taken
- Did not start burst lanes.
- Did not modify code.
- Left stop flag unchanged.

## Stop/continue decision
- **STOP (persisting)**.
- Rationale: explicit stop flag set for diminishing returns in auth/store mode.
