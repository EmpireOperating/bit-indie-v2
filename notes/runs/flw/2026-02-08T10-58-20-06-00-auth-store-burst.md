# 🎮 AUTO-FLW Bit Indie V2 — Auth/Store Construction Burst (Waves 17–18)

- Trigger: cron `24ab51e7-ceb8-4ee2-b0ab-27a98bd44e14`
- Mode: one 2-wave hybrid burst (sequential), strict non-overlap, no cosmetic churn
- Stop flag check: `ops/flw-auto-stop-biv2.json` => `stopped=false` (continued)

## Wave 17 (auth runtime telemetry emit boundaries)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /auth/storefront/construction/runtime/telemetry-emit-points` in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`.
   - Defines concrete headed/headless auth emit points (`auth.challenge_issued`, `auth.session_issued`, `auth.handoff_ready`, `auth.session_confirmed`).
   - Explicitly pins non-overlap boundary: auth emits lifecycle/handoff events, storefront emits entitlement execution events.
   - Connects auth emit surfaces to storefront telemetry runtime endpoint.
2. Added route test coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/auth.test.ts`.

## Wave 18 (storefront runtime entitlement emit surfaces)
Shipped:
1. Added `GET /storefront/scaffold/construction/entitlement-telemetry/runtime-emit-points` in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.ts`.
   - Defines runtime emit surfaces for entitlement path resolution/rejection and download consumption/rejection.
   - Splits headed/headless session input surfaces for tokenized entitlement handling.
   - Links upstream auth runtime emit map + executable handoff contract.
2. Added route test coverage in `apps/api/src/routes/storefront.test.ts`.
3. Updated endpoint inventory in `apps/api/README.md`.

Gate checkpoint (apps/api):
- `npm test --silent` ✅ (16 files, 203 tests)
- `npm run build --silent` ✅
- merge marker scan (`rg '^(<<<<<<<|=======|>>>>>>>)' src`) ✅ (none)

## Thrash / signal assessment
- Result: **high-signal** (new concrete runtime emit-point contracts across auth and storefront lanes + tests/docs).
- No consecutive PARTIAL pattern in this burst.
- Auto-stop criterion not met.

## Decision
- **CONTINUE** (stop flag unchanged).
- Next burst should wire these emit-point contracts into concrete telemetry payload construction inside release download/auth session handlers and add end-to-end trace fixture tests.
